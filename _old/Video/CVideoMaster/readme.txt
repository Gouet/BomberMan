Irrlicht SDK : 1.7.1
Drivers      : D3D9, OpenGL
License      : Irrlicht Engine License
Dependencies : Theora Playback Library

This is my initial Irrlicht implementation of the Theora Playback Library. It allows you to stream or RAM-play
any number of Ogg Theora videos and use them as an IImage or ITexture for all purposes in Irrlicht. It also
features an Audio Interface abstraction, so it's possible to use different audio libraries. For the demo I
implemented an OpenAL interface. Hence, the demo also depends on OpenAL.
